# ACTIVITIES

Let's start simple!

The tests in this project are simple scenarios at the Google site. Check them out [here](https://github.com/falessa/cypress-examples/blob/main/cypress/e2e/google-search/google_search.cy.js)

## Excersises

1. Review the existing tests. Try to understand what they do. Don't worry if you don't. Just try to have a general idea. We can check on details later.

2. Write other test cases you can identify for a Google search, or any behavior that can be validated in its website. Use the format you want. The only thing that matters is that is understandable.

3. Of those test cases pick 1 or 2 you would like to automate. Ideally, you'd pick the ones that have more priority or are business critical. However, given this is just for educational purposes don't worry if the test to automate does not add any value.
